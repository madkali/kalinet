Kalinet OS-dapp

*https://github.com/madkali

zdOS lab's was born from the passion of getting by and the ethereum ecosystem. The main purpose of zdOS is to be able to create the first "operating system-dapp" by merging collapse OS and Crypto-zombie dapp and my zdOS token. the idea of ​​this structure is to bring people to an educational purpose and a free computer system. zdOS has one and only founder and one employee and this will make creation a little faster. I ask you interested to contact me and zdOS and predisposed to the collaboration of all of you

Collapse OS is a z80 kernel and a collection of programs, tools and documentation that allows you to assemble an OS that, when completed, will be able to:

    Run on minimal and improvised machines.
    Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).
    Edit text files.
    Compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.
    Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.
    Replicate itself.

Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible. With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools.
Organisation of this repository

    kernel: Pieces of code to be assembled by the user into a kernel.
    apps: Pieces of code to be assembled into "userspace" application.
    recipes: collection of recipes that assemble parts together on a specific machine.
    doc: User guide for when you've successfully installed Collapse OS.
    tools: Tools for working with Collapse OS from "modern" environments. Mostly development tools, but also contains emulated zasm, which is necessary to build Collapse OS from a non-Collapse OS machine.

Each folder has a README with more details.
Status

The project unfinished but is progressing well! See [Collapse OS' website][web] for more information.

---- 19-3-20 update Kalinet ---- zdOS = wallet cita blockchain Collapse-dapp #work in progress#

---- 29-3-20 update road-map ---- zdOS = airdrop kalinet by zdOS token -link's for free zdOS token and server Kalinet OS This project was born 5 years ago. I was able to go beyond my skills starting from improvised compuert and a very low programming capacity and despite the work and the little time I decided to give zdOS tokens that with your help as it is an open-source project to participate in evolving this reality by contributing not with money but it goes by following the referral links affiliate marketing server and mining and with a follow me in github
